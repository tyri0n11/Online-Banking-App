BANKING APPLICATION


Abstract
The "Online Banking System Database" project, developed by a team of pre-graduate students under Dr. Nguyen Thi Thuy Loan's guidance focuses on establishing a secure, 
efficient database for modern banking operations. Prioritizing the safeguarding of customer credentials and account information, it addresses critical aspects of digital banking security and efficiency. 
This academic initiative, intended for educational purposes, aims to underpin online banking with a robust, secure system, facilitating safe account access and financial transactions. 
The report encompasses a comprehensive analysis, system design, and prospective enhancements, reflecting the collaborative educational endeavor of the group.

We express our sincere gratitude to the Teacher Assistant team for their invaluable guidance and insightful responses during the development of our system, 
which significantly contributed to its successful completion.
